# channelbranch

A front-end app that is a version of linktree so that I can put my links on my professional social links!

## Concept

it will show links to my social media with the right thumbnail. Here is the miro link: [channelbranch](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP0ZJa68=/?share_link_id=244048380532)

### Updates

- 2023-01-09, Able to render the data and images, and button links are working on click.
