# channelbranch

A front-end app that showcases my professional social links!

## Concept

This app will show links to my social media with the right thumbnail. Here is the miro link: [channelbranch](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP0ZJa68=/?share_link_id=244048380532)

- I did a brief breakdown of the styling of my app using Miro! I only did a mockup and styled and designed the necessary parts of the app that I want to have!

- 2023-01-18, Made a lot of changes on the arrangement of social links and added a posts section that contains hover effects and copy to url function. Added a few more functioning features such as show social name on hover on each site and copy url feature on the posts section. I will try and finish the form contact submission to my email tomorrow and also add a day and night scrolling!

  - The copy feature is using the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` line of code.
  - Here is the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText)

- 2023-01-21, Finalize the messaging in my small site using formsubmit backend API! For future projects on using nodemailer! I need to setup a separate backend file to establish connection to my frontend. Here is the current look of my site. I will finalize this project by adding a day and night toggle to view my small link site.

- 2023-02-04, Properly setup the width and height. Also, added a copy button for the actual site link (Might have to change that to a share to social button). Also added a sun and moon on the daynighttoggle.
